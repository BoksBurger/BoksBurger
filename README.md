# Hello World!
### My name is Burger.

I wrote my first piece of HTML and JavaScript in 1998 using notepad. More than 20 years later, I do pretty much the same thing.

At the moment, I spend most of my time creating solutions with JavaScript. I love JavaScript!

I hope that whatever I end up sharing here will either inspire you or at least save you some time on your own projects.

*Oh... and like world peace, I also strive to write clean readable and self-documenting code*
