# ðŸ‘‹ Hello World!
### My name is Burger.

I wrote my first piece of HTML and JavaScript in 1998 using notepad. More than 20 years later, I do pretty much the same thing.

At the moment, I spend most of my time creating solutions with JavaScript. I love JavaScript! :heart:

I hope that whatever I end up sharing here will either inspire you or at least save you some time on your own projects.

:star: I've recently competed the [HomeFinder](https://www.homefinder.co.za) project using React and node.js
