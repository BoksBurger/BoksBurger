# Hello World!
### My name is Burger.

I am a software developer with over 20 years of experience in web technologies.

At the moment, I spend most of my time creating solutions with JavaScript and NodeJS.

I was a bit late to the party when I dicovered that JavaScript can run outside the browser in 2018.

On my Raspberry Pi I installed NodeJS that ran some code at an interval that was monitoring an academic website where I was expecting to find results to be published for a practical violin exam I did.

I was fed up having to check the resluts on a daily basis, so I automated the process.

Looking for a way to run my JavaScript as a service somehow, I discovered NodeJS.

My code would scrape the resluts as soon as it gets published. Compile an email with the info and send it to me.

Since the I have expanded on what I have learned. 

I now write API's with NodeJS on the server-side with ReactJS on the client.

### In Closing
Whatever I end up sharing here, I hope it either inspires you or save you some time in your own projects.

*Oh... and like world peace, I also strive to write readable, self-documenting, unicorn code*
