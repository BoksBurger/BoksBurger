# Hello World!
### My name is Burger.

I am a software developer with over 20 years of experience in web technologies.

At the moment, I spend most of my time creating solutions with JavaScript.

I was a bit late to the party when I dicovered that JavaScript can run outside the browser in 2018.

Having to check if the academic website where I was expecting to find results to be published for a practical violin exam I did was cumbersome. 

So I decided to automate the process.

Looking for a way to run my JavaScript as a service somehow, I discovered NodeJS.

I eagerly whipped up some code that would scrape the resluts as soon as it got published and send me an email with the info.

On my Raspberry Pi I installed NodeJS to run the code at an hourly interval.

When future me eventually received the email with the news that I have passed with extinction, I could not decide what I was happier about. My marks or my code slaving away for three weeks before the results finally got published.

Since then I have expanded on what I have learned.

Nowadays I create entire API's with NodeJS on the server and React for the user interface.

### In Closing
Whatever I end up sharing here, I hope it either inspires you or saves you some time on your own projects.

*Oh... and like world peace, I also strive to write readable, self-documenting, unicorn code*
